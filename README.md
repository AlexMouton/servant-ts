WIP. Transitioning to this project as I finalize the API for [aeson-generic-ts](https://github.com/smaccoun/aeson-generic-ts/commit/42153bf1bfa8c0f8427dd2410b5b73a8ce597b45)

It is technically usable right now, but the API is fast moving and the configurability limited. See the tests folder for some examples and roughly what this is going to turn into
